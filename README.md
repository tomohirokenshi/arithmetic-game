# arithmetic-game

This project, though seemingly simple, holds a special place in my development journey. As my first solo application, built with VB.NET, it ignited my passion for software development. While the code itself might appear rudimentary, it served as an invaluable learning ground.

## Key Learnings

* **Event Handling:** I gained a foundational understanding of event handling, a crucial aspect of interactive applications. By mastering how UI elements respond to user actions, I learned to create more engaging and dynamic user experiences.
* **Application Design:** The process of designing this game, even with its aesthetic limitations, fostered essential problem-solving and code organization skills. It taught me to think critically about the user experience and how to effectively structure my code.
    * I learned that overcrowding the UI with too many objects can be visually distracting and hinder user focus. 
    * I also realized that an overly complex or visually confusing background can negatively impact the overall user experience. 
    * I learned the importance of good typography. Clear and consistent typography significantly enhances readability and overall user experience. For example, using appropriate font sizes, weights, and colors can improve visual hierarchy, making it easier for users to understand the information presented on the screen.
* **VB.NET Fundamentals:** This project provided a hands-on introduction to the VB.NET language, solidifying my understanding of core concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, and functions.

## Reflections

Looking back, I recognize the value of this project lies beyond its functionality. It instilled in me the perseverance to overcome challenges and the joy of bringing my ideas to life through code. This experience serves as a testament to the power of experimentation and the continuous pursuit of improvement in my software development journey.

## Side Note

I apologize if the code snippet is missing. This project was created some time ago, and my computer was unfortunately corrupted. Luckily, the executable file survived.
