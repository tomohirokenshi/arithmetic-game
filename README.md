# arithmetic-game

This project, though seemingly simple, holds a special place in my development journey. As my first solo application, built with VB.NET, it ignited my passion for software development. While the code itself might appear rudimentary, it served as an invaluable learning ground.

## Key Learnings

* **Event Handling:** I gained a foundational understanding of event handling, a crucial aspect of interactive applications. By mastering how UI elements respond to user actions, I learned to create more engaging and dynamic user experiences.
* **Application Design:** The process of designing this game, even with its aesthetic limitations, fostered essential problem-solving and code organization skills. It taught me to think critically about the user experience and how to effectively structure my code.
* **VB.NET Fundamentals:** This project provided a hands-on introduction to the VB.NET language, solidifying my understanding of core concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, and functions.

## Reflections

Looking back, I recognize the value of this project lies beyond its functionality. It instilled in me the perseverance to overcome challenges and the joy of bringing my ideas to life through code. This experience serves as a testament to the power of experimentation and the continuous pursuit of improvement in my software development journey.
